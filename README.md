# JADD_occlusion
This is a repository for the analysis code and raw data for "The Integration of Occlusion and Disparity Information for Judging Depth in Autism Spectrum Disorder", available at DOI 10.1007/s10803-017-3234-x.

Please see the /r/ directory, which uses pre-processed data, for ease-of-use. Individual psychometric functions can be reproduced from the raw data in the /standalone/ directory.

* NOTE: Version of R and packages used in ‘sessionInfo.txt’. I cannot guarantee the code will run on later versions (especially the publication-ready tables, graphs, and post-hoc tests as afex and ggplot have undergone major changes to how they access certain information).*
